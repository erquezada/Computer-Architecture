 ``### Folders & Files

- **Ascii-Art**: Contains C programs that work with ASCII art. These programs may generate or manipulate ASCII art representations.
  
- **C-Programming-Language**: A collection of C programs that demonstrate core concepts in C programming, suitable for educational purposes or learning.

- **IO**: Includes input/output operations examples in C. It covers reading from and writing to files, standard input/output handling, and possibly user interactions.

- **Lauter**: Could contain a C project or tool related to Lauter (possibly a concept, library, or framework). Please refer to the folder for details.

- **Tokenizer**: Includes implementations related to tokenization in C. It can help split strings based on delimiters or patterns.

- **sortArgDemo**: A C program demonstrating argument sorting, possibly showing how command-line arguments are handled and sorted.

- **src**: The source directory where the main C code files are located. This folder holds the core logic and functionality of the project.

- **LICENSE**: The license file that provides the terms under which the code in the repository can be used, modified, and shared.

- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository and details about the project structure and its contents.

- **hello.c**: A basic C program, likely printing a "Hello, World!" message or serving as an introductory example of C programming.

- **Video-Toy**: Could be a project or demo related to video manipulation or processing, implemented in C. Please refer to the folder for more details.
