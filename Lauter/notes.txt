Encodings and Interrupts:
When we talk about encodings we are referring to the data we want to work on. In computer science everything is a number.
But to make the relationship between the cute cat image and the bits sequences that is used to encode the image data.
Integers are unsigned integers and signed integers, for the signed integers what we have is simply binary representation in a 
positional system.
For signed integers, we have two's complement representation of the number of bits in the number of bits
n bits that we solve in the bytes of 8 bits each. n can be any number greater than 0.
n = 8, n = 16, n = 32, n = 64, n = 128
