## Installation
- Install required C development packages (Linux only)
    - I'll post instructions soon...
    - In the meantime you can try compiling and see what's missing based on the error messages. (Or take a look here: https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP430-GCC-OPENSOURCE)
- Open root directory
- `make`
- `cd ./pong`
- Connect your "MSP430G2 Launchpad" board through USB
- `make load`
- Press your MSP's reset button
- Start playing!

Enjoy!
